node-pack

This is a copy of PHP's pack/unpack function made into a nodejs module.
Its a 100% clone with an additional options.

* A new feature where we can populate an existing Buffer is now there, so
* the caller can
worry about Buffer management. Simply make the first parameter a buffer

* Also we can supply an array of values, rather than arguments, so the 2nd
* parameter is an array.
ie. pack( "VV", [ 23,55 ] );

* Added a Perl style format that was missing, which is format character "V"
* and "v"



## Install

To install this Pack util, sorry~~ the author don't have the npm's account...Please wait patiently ~~ðŸ˜‚

## Packing Bytes Test
    
To test packing bytes, run
	 $ node test/test.js
    $ node test/speedtest.js
    
To use in code,
	var pack = require( 'pagepack' );
	var buffer = pack.pack( "CCCV", [ 1,2,3, 12345679 ] );

## note

the Buffer prototype has some very useful function like buf.writeUInt32BE... So , if you know the detail of pack.. you can use these functions to complete your work by node..

this C++ module i find it in raul's homepage..but it can't compile successfully, so i fixed it..however, it is not very useful,unless you have to pack a very big data.....
